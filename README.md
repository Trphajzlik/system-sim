# system-sim
Small project for a school subject. It's just a transition system.

To run, first adjust `setup.py` with desired setup, including output paths.
Then just run the `main.py`.

You'll get the whole history of simulation in csv format in `OUTPUT_FILE`
and generated graph of the history in `GRAPH_PATH`.

Do not forget to create the directory structure for data.

In `model_overview.png` you can see overview of our model.
